      <title>Divorces with SERIOUS Consequences in Medieval Europe </title>
      <description>In medieval Europe, legal divorce as understood today did not exist; instead, marriages were primarily dissolved through annulments or legal separations. Annulments declared a marriage invalid from the start, while separations allowed spouses to live apart, but did not allow remarriage.  In the case of Royalty this got really messy at times

      <title>Getting Divorced in History Sucks</title>
      <description>How did we get to modern divorce rates? Divorce laws and practices have evolved significantly throughout history, from ancient codified rules to modern no-fault divorce systems. The earliest evidence of divorce laws can be found in ancient Mesopotamia, with the Code of Hammurabi (1760 BC) outlining divorce procedures. Modern divorce patterns emerged in the 18th and 19th centuries, influenced by changing societal views on marriage and the concept of "love marriages". In the United States, the shift towards no-fault divorce, exemplified by California's 1969 law, dramatically increased divorce rates.

      <title>The Weird History of Forks and More</title>
      <description>Eating utensils have been used since the Stone Age of mankind. During this time, eating utensils consisted of simple sharp stones intended for cutting meat and fruit.

Some eating utensils were created and first used by our Paleolithic ancestors over 500,000 years ago, while others were introduced only short 1000 years ago during European Middle Ages.

Some eating utensils were created and first used by our Paleolithic ancestors over 500,000 years ago, while others were introduced only short 1000 years ago during European Middle Ages.</p><p><br></p><p>Travel to Turkey and Mongolia with me <a href="https://trovatrip.com/host/profiles/steven-3mjc0">here</a></p><p>Check out our sister podcast the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/6uVF7yzhH4uJsogaZU67iL?si=cdae211331204131">Mystery of Everything</a></p><p>Coffee Collab With The Lore Lodge <a href="https://tablowroastingco.com/products/history-mystery-bundle">COFFEE</a></p><p>Bonus episodes as well as ad-free episodes on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/stakuyi"><strong>Patreon</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>Find us on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stakuyi"><strong>Instagram</strong></a>.

      <title>Bonus: The American Desire To Take Back The Panama Canal</title>
      <description>Do not stay ignorant of the world around you: go to https://groundnews.com/historyofeverything and get 40% off the Vantage plan, the same one that I use!

At the beginning of the 20th century, an expanding United States wanted a way to expedite naval passage between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. And in 1904, Panama granted the United States the right to build and operate a canal and control five miles of land on either side of the water.  But ownership of the region had been a thorny issue for decades as Panamanians were locked out of the prosperity the canal created right in their own front yard, and in 1977 President Carter signed a treaty with Panamanian Chief of Government Omar Torrijos to return the canal area to Panama.

Since then, Panama has invested nearly $6 billion to improve the infrastructure and increase the shipping capacity to expand the canal’s use worldwide.  

The Panama Canal was not an issue in the 2024 election, but in December, President Trump began claiming that the United States, the shipping lane’s biggest user, was “being severely overcharged and not treated fairly” and threatened to “take [the canal] back or something very powerful is going to happen.”

      <title>The French Failure of The Panama Canal</title>
      <description>The French effort to build a sea-level canal through Panama’s mountainous jungle failed due to dangerous, difficult work, insurmountable financial problems, ceaseless rains that triggered mudslides, and corruption and scandal. The French company in charge went bankrupt in 1889, with an estimated 20,000 workers dead. The French had spent $262,000,000 on the project, with little to show. The U.S. later purchased the French company’s equipment and promised to do it differently

      <title>The Rise And Fall Of The Yuan Dynasty</title>
      <description>The Yuan dynasty was established by Mongol nomads that ruled portions and eventually all of China from the early 13th century to 1368. Mongol suzerainty eventually also stretched throughout most of Asia and eastern Europe, though the Yuan emperors were rarely able to exercise much control over their more distant possessions.

      <title>Cruel and Unusual Punishment in History</title>
      <description>Criminal punishment in most of the Western world is fairly straightforward today; most who have committed a crime can simply expect either a fine or varying amounts of prison time based on their misdeed’s severity. Or hey if the issue is light enough or the person perhaps influential enough then maybe they could get away with community service. These, however, haven’t always been simple facts.

      <title>USS Liberty: The Hidden War Crime</title>
      <description>Israel and the United States have been allies for decades. However, during the 1967 Six-Day War, a conflict in which the U.S. vowed to remain neutral, Israel launched a devastating strike on a U.S. naval vessel in international waters. Thirty-four were killed, 171 injured, and the ship suffered severe damage. Both countries officially labeled the attack an accident, but questions have surrounded the event ever since.

      <title>The Wild World Of Royal Incest</title>
      <description>It may seem taboo today, but before, monarchs will do anything -- and we mean, anything -- to preserve their power and one of the ways they did this was to marry within the family. The act is called consanguinity where biological relatives marry each other is a foolproof plan to destruction. Inbreeding can lead to diseases and deformities throughout history, monarchs who are produced in inbreeding often led their rule in mayhem and disarray. But WHY does this happen? Well let us look at that today

      <title>Propaganda in Vietnam: The Battle of Khe Sanh</title>
      <description>The Battle of Khe Sanh began on January 21, 1968, when forces from the People’s Army of North Vietnam (PAVN) carried out a massive artillery bombardment on the U.S. Marine garrison at Khe Sanh, located in South Vietnam near the border with Laos. For the next 77 days, U.S. Marines and their South Vietnamese allies fought off an intense siege of the garrison, one of the longest and bloodiest battles of the Vietnam War.

      <title>Beating The Crap out of People HISTORICALLY (Tournaments)</title>
      <description>The Medieval Tournament was a forum for European knights where they could practice and show off their military skills in activities such as jousting or the mêlée, indulge in a bit of pageantry, display their chivalrous qualities and win both riches and glory. From the 10th to 16th century CE tournaments were the principal expression of aristocratic ideals such as chivalry and noble lineage where family arms and honor were put on the line, ladies were wooed and even national pride was at stake.

      <title>The Legendary Story of the Czechoslovak Legion</title>
      <description>Brokered by Czech and Slovak independence leaders, the Legion was formed by the Russian military during WWI to fight Austria-Hungary. After the Revolution, the Legion became entangled in the Civil War and Allied anti-Bolshevik schemes, while its officers meddled in local Russian politics. The Legion took control of the Trans-Siberian Railroad and aligned with the White Armies. After two years of fighting its way through Siberia, the Legion signed a truce with the Bolsheviks, gaining safe passage to Vladivostok, where it was evacuated on Allied ships.

      <title>The Battle Of Ia Drang Valley: Horrors of Vietnam</title>
      <description>In the fall of 1965 the Vietnam War was an event most Americans saw as a series of smaller battles leaving little to remember. That all would change when the First Cavalry Air Mobile Division flew into the Ia Drang Valley in the central highlands of South Vietnam.
The Air Mobile Division was a new concept. Battalions would use helicopters to be transferred in and out as artillery support came in from above. This allowed troops to be quickly brought in and out for battle. The central highlands had few roads and challenging terrain, making air mobility the only viable mode of transportation.
The Battle of the la Drang Valley would come to be remembered as one of the most iconic battles of the Vietnam War, and later would set the scene for the film We Were Soldiers based on the novel We Were Soldiers Once……And Young. It was the first major combat action between U.S. ground forces and the North Vietnamese Army. And it all began early one fall day.

      <title>The Peacock Dress: When Britain Wed India</title>
      <description>Here we will be diving into another random piece of history. The original peacock dress was designed by Jean-Phillipe Worth and worn by Mary Curzon, the Baroness of Kendleston at the 1902 Coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra.
It’s one of the most famous dresses in history, and it was a massive undertaking, resulting in one of the most ambitious reconstruction projects of all time.

      <description>Frederick Barbarossa (which literally translates as “the red beard”) was one of medieval Europe’s most famous rulers. Originally from Swabia, Germany, he grew up and united almost 1600 German states and micro-states, was crowned Holy Roman Emperor, went on two crusades, was excommunicated, supported an anti-pope, reconciled his relationship with the Pope once more and built diplomatic relationships with royal houses across Europe, from Byzantium to the British Isles.

      <title>History of Everything: The Fall of Napoleon</title>
      <description>Napoleon Bonaparte, also known as Napoleon I, was a French military leader and emperor who conquered much of Europe in the early 19th century. Born on the island of Corsica, Napoleon rapidly rose through the ranks of the military during the French Revolution (1789-1799). After seizing political power in France in a 1799 coup d’état, he crowned himself emperor in 1804. Shrewd, ambitious and a skilled military strategist, Napoleon successfully waged war against various coalitions of European nations and expanded his empire. He was far more impressive than what ridley scott presents.

      <title>BONUS: Why Can No One Buy A House</title>
      <description>President Biden worries about high housing costs. So do Republicans in Congress. The consensus reflects a major problem: Tens of millions of families, across red and blue states, struggle with rent and home prices. The reason is a longstanding housing shortage whose problem goes back further.

But action in Washington won’t make a huge difference. America’s affordable housing crisis is likely to be solved in cities and states...but only after much time and struggle

      <title>Sacred Band of Thebes: Gay or Nay?</title>
      <description>To gay or not to gay, that is the question. The Sacred Band of Thebes was an elite unit of the Theban army comprised of purportedly 150 gay male couples totaling 300 men. This is a force that for years would remain undefeated in battle until they were wiped out to the last man by Alexander the Great. But What is their story? How did they become so famous? And why are they both not talked about enough and too much? The heroics of these men are legendary, but how much of it is legend?

      <title>Alexander the Great and The Conquest of the World</title>
      <description>Alexander the Great was an ancient Macedonian ruler and one of history’s greatest military minds who, as King of Macedonia and Persia, established the largest empire the ancient world had ever seen. By turns charismatic and ruthless, brilliant and power hungry, diplomatic and bloodthirsty, Alexander inspired such loyalty in his men they’d follow him anywhere and, if necessary, die in the process. Though Alexander the Great died before realizing his dream of uniting a new realm, his influence on Greek and Asian culture was so profound that it inspired a new historical epoch—the Hellenistic Period.

      <title>The CIA, The Congo, and a GIANT Mess</title>
      <description>When the Democratic Republic of Congo gained independence from Belgium on June 30, 1960, it was part of a wave of optimism sweeping through Africa. Its new prime minister, the 35-year old Patrice Lumumba, was one of the faces of that optimism. But just two-and-a-half months later he had been removed from office by military officers and was killed by a firing squad in January 1961. But what happened with the CIA?

      <title>Introducing Black History, For Real</title>
      <description>A 109 year old Black woman fights for reparations for her neighborhood that was burned to the ground when she was a child. The first woman on to the FBI’s Most Wanted Terrorist List was a Black Panther. The richest person of all time, an African king, gave away so much gold that it caused Cairo's economy to crash… for over a decade. On Wondery’s history series Black History, For Real, hosts Franchesca Ramsey and Conscious Lee go beyond the stories you already know to drop you right in the mix. It’s a no-nonsense, unwhitewashed account of history’s most overlooked moments, with a mix of narrative storytelling and candid conversation. We’ll even spill the occasional historical tea! It’s all facts, no cap.

      <title>The Cholera Epidemic That Changed Britain Forever</title>
      <description>In the mid-1800s, London physician John Snow made a startling observation that would change the way that we view diseases and how they propagate. He created a map depicting where cases of cholera occurred in London’s West End and found them to be clustered around a water pump on Broad Street. This led him to believe that cholera was a waterborne disease, a conclusion that went against the Victorian “miasma theory” in which Londoners ascribed the source of cholera to bad airs or vapors entering the human body John Snow’s conviction about the source for the London outbreak and his concern for public health compelled him to oppose the popular beliefs of his time and convince the local council in London’s West End to disable the water pump on Broad Street.

      <title>France On Fire: The Revolution</title>
      <description>The French Revolution was a watershed event in world history that began in 1789 and ended in the late 1790s with the ascent of Napoleon Bonaparte. During this period, French citizens radically altered their political landscape, uprooting centuries-old institutions such as the monarchy and the feudal system. The upheaval was caused by disgust with the French aristocracy and the economic policies of King Louis XVI, who met his death by guillotine, as did his wife Marie Antoinette. Though it degenerated into a bloodbath during the Reign of Terror, the French Revolution helped to shape modern democracies by showing the power inherent in the will of the people.

      <itunes:summary>The French Revolution was a watershed event in world history that began in 1789 and ended in the late 1790s with the ascent of Napoleon Bonaparte. During this period, French citizens radically altered their political landscape, uprooting centuries-old institutions such as the monarchy and the feudal system. The upheaval was caused by disgust with the French aristocracy and the economic policies of King Louis XVI, who met his death by guillotine, as did his wife Marie Antoinette. Though it degenerated into a bloodbath during the Reign of Terror, the French Revolution helped to shape modern democracies by showing the power inherent in the will of the people.

      <title>Boxer Rebellion and the End of China</title>
      <description>In the Boxer Rebellion of 1900, a Chinese secret organization called the Society of the Righteous and Harmonious Fists led an uprising in northern China against the spread of Western and Japanese influence there. The rebels, referred to by Westerners as Boxers because they performed physical exercises they believed would make them able to withstand bullets, killed foreigners and Chinese Christians and destroyed foreign property.
From June to August, the Boxers besieged the foreign district of China’s capital city Beijing (then called Peking) until an international force that included American troops subdued the uprising. By the terms of the Boxer Protocol, which officially ended the rebellion in 1901, China agreed to pay more than $330 million in reparations.

      <title>Sinking Submarine Disasters </title>
      <description>Since the Second World War, the United States, Russia, and China—and a host of other nations—have lost vessels and their crews to accidents. Operating submarines is a risky business under the best of circumstances—and will likely remain so. Even the highest technology nuclear submarines can end up on the ocean floor if the crew isn’t careful or the technology fails.

      <title>Bonus Episode: How Inbred Were The Habsburgs?</title>
      <description>This Episode comes from Youtube
The Royal House of Habsburg, one of the most powerful dynasties of Medieval and Renaissance Europe, reigned over much of Europe for centuries. But genetic inheritance and the perils of inbreeding may explain their demise.
Like many royal families their expansion and hold on power came about in part through inter-family marriages. But over time, generation after generation of inbreeding, helped contribute to some of the physical ailments that often plagued the family as well as the distinctive look with their big lower lips, long noses and the distinctive “Habsburg jaw.”

      <title>Peter The Greats Journey To The West</title>
      <description>A monarch travelling in disguise on a secret mission to build an alliance and discover technology to save his empire? What is this, a fantasy novel? No This is the Grand Embassy of Peter The Great. Having already sent some young nobles abroad to study nautical matters, Peter, in 1697, went with the so-called Grand Embassy to western Europe. The embassy comprised about 250 people, with the “grand ambassadors” Franz Lefort, Fyodor Alekseyevich Golovin, and Prokopy Voznitsyn at its head. Its chief purposes were to examine the international situation and to strengthen the anti-Turkish coalition, but it was also intended to gather information on the economic and cultural life of Europe.

      <title>Bonus History of Everything: How Snipers Changed War Youtube Episode</title>
      <description>Snipers are the most feared rifleman on the battlefield. With an average of around one enemy death per 250,000 rounds fired in the modern Global War on Terror, a sniper who only fires on average around 1.3 rounds per kill stands out as a terribly lethal soldier. The elite training and precision rifles given to the modern sniper only enhance that fearsome reputation as the dealer of carefully selected death from afar.

      <title>History of Everything: Atilla The Hun, The Scourge of God</title>
      <description>Also called Flagellum Dei, or the “scourge of God,” Attila was known to Romans for his brutality and a penchant for sacking and pillaging Roman cities. He's considered one of the greatest “barbarian” rulers in history, having successfully expanded the rule of the Huns and maintained a near-perfect record in battle.

      <title>History of Everything: The Warsaw Uprising</title>
      <description>On August 1, 1944, the Polish Home Army, a non-Communist underground resistance movement, initiated the Warsaw uprising to liberate the city from the German occupation and reclaim Polish independence. The impetus for the military action was the ongoing retreat of the German forces from Poland, followed by the appearance of the Soviet Red Army along the east bank of the Vistula River. By October 2, 1944, the Germans had suppressed the uprising, deporting civilians to concentration and forced-labor camps and reducing Warsaw to ruins. It is a terrible tale but one that must be told.

      <title>History of Everything: The Bonkers Borgias of Italy</title>
      <description>The Borgias, led by patriarch Rodrigo, are a family of outsiders from Spain who try to take over control of Renaissance-era Italy. Through the use of bribery, extortion and torture, Rodrigo rises up the ranks to become pope. Two of Rodrigo's children are used as pawns by being married off to members of rival families at a young age. Vanozza, Rodrigo's long-time mistress and mother of his children, and Giulia Farnese battle for the elder Borgia's affections. The story of the Borgias has inspired such works as Machiavelli's political treatise `The Prince' and Mario Puzo's `The Godfather'. This is their story and oh boy is it insane

        <![CDATA[<p>The Borgias, led by patriarch Rodrigo, are a family of outsiders from Spain who try to take over control of Renaissance-era Italy. Through the use of bribery, extortion and torture, Rodrigo rises up the ranks to become pope. Two of Rodrigo's children are used as pawns by being married off to members of rival families at a young age. Vanozza, Rodrigo's long-time mistress and mother of his children, and Giulia Farnese battle for the elder Borgia's affections.

      <title>Bonus History of Everything: The Monster Emperor Nero</title>
      <description>Everyone we are going to start uploading the audio of some youtube episodes to the podcast channel. This is the first of that Series. The episode will post likely on tuesday, wednesday, or thursday of the week depending on the amount as well as filming so please enjoy.

Nero Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus was the fifth Roman emperor and final emperor of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, reigning from AD 54 until his death in AD 68. He was adopted by the Roman emperor Claudius at the age of 13 and succeeded him on the throne. Nero was popular with the members of his Praetorian Guard and lower-class commoners in Rome and its provinces, but he was deeply resented by the Roman aristocracy. Most contemporary sources describe him as tyrannical, self-indulgent, and debauched. After being declared a public enemy by the Roman Senate, he committed suicide at age 30.

      <title>History of Everything: The Mad Queen of Madagascar</title>
      <description>In 1828, after the death of her husband, Queen Ranavalona I. came into power by killing all other potential regents (wives, sons, mothers). At that time, she was between 30 and 40 years old. Ranavalona I. went down in history rather ingloriously and bears the surname “the cruel”. Many Malagasy call her regency tany maizina, in English “years of darkness”. But despite this she is still a rather complex character. One who did amazing and terrible things at the same time.

      <title>History of Everything: Hawaii and Kamehameha (Former Patron Exclusive)</title>
      <description>I will say this right now. I am sorry for my pronunciation in some of this. I did try but there was quite a lot.
Kamehameha I, also known as Kamehameha the Great, was the conqueror and first ruler of the Kingdom of Hawaii. The state of Hawaii gave a statue of him to the National Statuary Hall Collection in Washington, D.C. as one of two statues it is entitled to install there.
This is a patron episode as I had to replace the original due to being sick, I apologize for any confusion

      <title>History of Everything: The Marian Reforms</title>
      <description>The Marian reforms were reforms of the ancient Roman army implemented in 107 BC by the statesman Gaius Marius, for whom they were later named. The reforms originated as a reaction to the military and logistical stagnation of the Roman Republic in the late 2nd century BC. While these saved Rome, They would also help to destroy it.

      <title>History of Everything: The Age of War in Japan</title>
      <description>The Sengoku Period, also known as the Warring States Period, was a turbulent and violent period of Japanese history when rival warlords or daimyo fought bitterly for control of Japan. The period falls within the Muromachi period (Muromachi Jidai, 1333-1573 CE) of Japanese medieval history when the Ashikaga shogun capital was located in the Muromachi area of Heiankyo (Kyoto). The beginning of the Sengoku period witnessed the Onin War (1467-1477 CE) which destroyed Heiankyo. The fighting that followed over the next century would eventually reduce the warlords to only a few hundred in number as the country was effectively carved up into princedoms. Eventually, one warlord rose above all his rivals: Oda Nobunaga, who set Japan on the road to unification from 1568 CE.

      <title>64: History of Everything: The Wonderful World of Silk</title>
      <description>Silk is a fabric first produced in Neolithic China from the filaments of the cocoon of the silk worm. It became a staple source of income for small farmers and, as weaving techniques improved, the reputation of Chinese silk spread so that it became highly desired across the empires of the ancient world. As China's most important export for much of its history, the material gave its name to the great trading network the Silk Road, which connected East Asia to Europe, India, and Africa

      <title>49 History of Everything: The Zulu and the battle of Rorkes Drift</title>
      <description>The Battle of Rorke's Drift (1879), also known as the Defence of Rorke's Drift, was an engagement in the Anglo-Zulu War. The successful British defence of the mission station of Rorke's Drift, under the command of Lieutenants John Chard of the Royal Engineers and Gonville Bromhead, 24th Regiment of Foot began when a large contingent of Zulu warriors broke off from their main force during the final hour of the British defeat at the day-long Battle of Isandlwana on 22 January 1879, diverting 6 miles (9.7 km) to attack Rorke's Drift later that day and continuing into the following day.

      <title>42 History of Everything: The Wacky Story of Banking</title>
      <description>Banks have existed since at least the 14th century. They provide a safe place for consumers and business owners to stow their cash and a source of loans for personal purchases and business ventures. In turn, the banks use the cash that is deposited to make loans and collect interest on them.
The basic business plan hasn't changed much since the Medici family started dabbling in banking during the Renaissance, but the range of products that banks offer has grown drastically. Join me and Bard as we go through this story

      <title>41 History of Everything: Ruins of Empire</title>
      <description>A little more than a century ago, independent thinkers across Asia sought to frame a distinct intellectual tradition that would inspire the continent's rise to dominance. Yet this did not come to pass, and today those thinkers―Tagore, Gandhi, and later Nehru in India; Liang Qichao and Sun Yat-sen in China; Jamal al-Din al-Afghani and Abdurreshi al Ibrahim of the Ottoman Empire―are seen as outsiders within the main anticolonial tradition.

      <title>38 History of Everything: The Great Wall</title>
      <description>Enjoy this sneak peak into an extra episode that gets released for my patrons every week. If you want more content then make sure to check out my patreon and youtube!

In c. 220 B.C., under Qin Shi Huang, sections of earlier fortifications were joined together to form a united defence system against invasions from the north. Construction continued up to the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), when the Great Wall became the world's largest military structure. Its historic and strategic importance is matched only by its architectural significance.

      <description>Hello Everyone,
Yes it is not the crusades and I do apologize. You may be confused because I state in this that it is a Patreon Exclusive. Well the Reason for that is because I have pneumonia this week and have barely been able to speak. So no recording for me but my patrons were kind enough to let me use one of the many exclusives there. I am sorry about the delay. In the meantime I am doing a lot of writing and hope to share with those of you that want to join on patreon several weeks worth of podcasts next week. This is your all's freebie on sieges this week

History is filled with incapable leaders (the modern world is too, but that’s another story), but it’s hard to find any that are quite as incompetent as Sultan Ibrahim of the Ottoman Empire. Reigning from 1640 until his inevitable execution in 1648, he earned the title Ibrahim the Mad. However, considering the guy spent his entire upbringing in a cage, it’s not really a shock that he wasn’t a good ruler.
